    "The given file `PricesSales.xls` contains sales data for a commodity along with two variables p1 and p2 which can predict the sales. Given this dataset we need to build linear regression models and visualise their predictions. Use the following steps for training and visualising :\n",

Using Ordinary Least Squares from [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html), train 3 different Linear Regression models with 1) only p1 as an independent variable (Model-1), 2) only p2 as an independent variable (Model-2), and 3) both [p1, p2] in independent variables (Model-3).
